\begin{abstract}Herein, we examine the problem of a single provider offering multiple types of service level agreements, the implications thereof, and finally simulate scenarios of a hypothetical provider managing these agreements under various stressful situations.  We use usage management techniques in tandem with control-theoretic constructs to provide automated control and management of simulated system resources in the scenarios in question.  In order to effectively engage with these types of techniques, we first analyze the system from both a usage management and control theoretic perspective, extracting service level objectives and indicators that are then profiled and managed.
