The past few years have witnessed unprecedented expansion of commercial computing operations as the idea of cloud computing has become more mainstream and widely adopted by forward thinking technical organizational leadership.  This rate of adoption promises to increase in the near future as well.  With this expansion has come opportunity as well as risk, embodied by recent major service outages at leading cloud providers like Amazon.  These issues promise to become more difficult to control as managed infrastructure expands.  This expansion will simply not be possible without large amounts of automation in all aspects of cloud computing systems.
